# hello-world
completing the Hello-World  guide
This is Marlene and this is my very first experience in github. My favorite place to be is outside -- preferably in the mountains with family (hubby or twin-sis) and my puppies (Grace and Gus).

--not sure where to write a committ message .. I added content about myself to the readme file as an introduction.
